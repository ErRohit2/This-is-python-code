# How to check the type of variable ;
# check for type => store in variable = type(varible name)
# for example
# vaiable :-
# ================== 
#  varible is a conatener you should want to take a string or float or in type varible in 
#  a contaner . and also overwrite the varible that means varible
# # are changeble || called varible
# a=90
# b="rohit"
# c=98.89
# typeA = type(a)
# typeB =type(b)
# typeC=type(c); 
# # b=90
# # c=typeA+b
# # print(c)
# print(typeA)
# print(typeB)
# print(typeC)

# Type Casting : -
# ====================== >

# For eg :-
# e = "31"
# print(e) Error Because Its a Sring 
# e=int(31)    # or 
# e = int/float(e)   # called  type casting change datatype
# print(e)
 
# a = str(70+90)
# print(a)

# int string float make datatype then :- int convert into float string 
#                                         float convert into int string
#                                          string convert into float int
